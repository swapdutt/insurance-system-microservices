# Insurance System Microservices

## Introduction:
This is a sample module for an insurance system. The module provides an opportunity for the customer to buy a policy from an insurance company and manage their claims when required. The system is primarily designed to make sure the customer doesn't face any problem from buying of the policy from the organization till the policy decision, claim system when the customer opts for claim of the insurance during the case of emergency etc.
In this project, only the back-end of the system is going to be implemented, although the front-end was included while designing the entire system.
